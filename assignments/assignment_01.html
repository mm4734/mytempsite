      <h2>Description</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <p class="bioText">The image above shows the first published bar chart, created by William Playfair in 1781. The creation of this chart was inspired by Joseph Priestley's 1765 timeline charts. PLayfair utlized this type of chart, because he was lacking time series-data. According to Beniger and Robyn, "His bar chart was the first quantitative graphic form that did not locate data either in space (as did coordinated and tables) or tieme (as did Priestley's time-lines). It constitutes a pure solutions ot the problem of disrete quantitative comparison." </p>

Stacked Bar Charts break broader categories into smaller parts that are then stacked on top of each other, vertically or horizontally. Varying patterns or colors distinguish the different groups within the larger category, which is represented by the entire length of the bar. The images below show two examples of stacked bar chart. One is a stacked bar chart conveying the ways in which pork can be cut and appreciated, the other shows how politically aware people perceive themselves. Clustered bar charts are particularly good for understanding patterns as they include subcategories next to each other, as opposed to a stacked bar chart.
