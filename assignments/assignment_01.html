      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="bioText">The image above shows the first published bar chart, created by William Playfair in 1781. The creation of this chart was inspired by Joseph Priestley's 1765 timeline charts. PLayfair utlized this type of chart, because he was lacking time series-data. According to Beniger and Robyn, "His bar chart was the first quantitative graphic form that did not locate data either in space (as did coordinated and tables) or tieme (as did Priestley's time-lines). It constitutes a pure solutions ot the problem of disrete quantitative comparison."</p>
